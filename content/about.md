## Whoami

Hello! I'm a software engineer from Poland. I am interested in topics related to distributed systems, functional
programming and low-level tools for profiling Unix systems, particularly tools based on eBPF technology.

However, I have not always been involved in software engineering – my formal education is an MSc in theoretical
mathematics (aka pure mathematics). In the world of the queen of sciences, my interests focused on modern algebraic
geometry.

## What is this blog about?

My goal is to publish posts mainly on the subject of building distributed systems and anything else that I find
interesting at any given moment — I assume that my readers have a moderately high level of computer science culture.

## Whoami --no-tech

In addition to everything I mentioned above, I am interested in Christian apologetics – the thoughts of the Church
Fathers and, above all, the view/explanation of other religions from the perspective of Christian theology. I probably
won't discuss this topic on this blog, but I have a few thoughts that may be published.

Another topic that takes up my time is learning jazz and playing the piano. I will almost certainly not publish anything
on these matters.

## The aim of this blog

The goal of this blog will be achieved when at least one real, living and non-AI person benefits from it or become
inspired by materials found here. I have noticed that, paradoxically, although we live in an age of enormous information
noise (further amplified by AI), it is challenging to find posts on the use of advanced technologies. Most developers do
not have the time or simply do not want to publish their thoughts, which is totally understandable as we are all limited
by time, commitments or other hobbies. I decided to simply add my small contribution to this noise — but in a form free
of advertisements and invitations to yet another mailing list. __My materials are and always will be available for free,
without advertisements and (hopefully) without the need of ~~JavaScript~~.__
